Mobile Development Problem
You're a successful Shopify merchant! You've been busy promoting your store, and in the whirlwind of marketing, dealing with suppliers, and shipping orders—you've completely forgotten to run some reports on your latest orders. Create a mobile app that calculates and displays the following data:
The amount (in Canadian dollars) spent by Napoleon Batz, one of your favourite customers!
The number of Awesome Bronze Bags that have sold (total quantity)

You can access your orders with this link:
https://shopicruit.myshopify.com/admin/orders.json?page=1&access_token=c32313df0d0ef512ca64d5b336a0d7c6

Note that the link is only for the first page of orders (for this challenge you can ignore any additional pages). If you’re using Android, here are a couple simple libraries that you can use to fetch the data (these are optional, you can pick one or use any other alternative):
https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html
http://square.github.io/okhttp/

A description of the data for each order is available in the Shopify API documentation here:
https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/order

What you need to submit:
As plain text, submit the total spent by Napoleon Batz and the number of Awesome Bronze Bags sold
A screenshot of your app showing, in a simple view, the total spent by Napoleon Batz and the number of Awesome Bronze Bags sold
Your project code (either as a zip file, or a link to a public github repository)
